Following is a bulleted list of thoughts / tasks, of what must or is nice to have in no particular order. Some of these will be implemented soon others later and others maybe never. In any case, this list will change frequently and will serve as a rough road-map and a reminder.

* Design and implement “apply to database”. (Resolving and such).
* Implement delete iterators.
* Support Unicode builds.
* Support internationalization.
* Design an extensible field type system???
* Try to minimize friendship between classes.
* GUI for schema design.
* Possibly a full-fledged meta-schema designer and relevant services???
* Tablesets. Collections of Tables with relations and constraints???
* Eliminate noisy (testing alternate implementations) code. Namely null handling, string as string and the various smart pointer incarnations (stick to one).
