How to set up a Solution in Qt Creator
======================================

==== Step 1
Put following snippet in every .pro file:
------------------------- snippet ---
CONFIG(debug, debug|release) {
    PATH_SUFFIX = Debug
} else {
    PATH_SUFFIX = Release
}

OBJECTS_DIR = $$_PRO_FILE_PWD_/$$PATH_SUFFIX/$$TARGET-obj
------------------------- snippet end ---

==== Step 2
Tell QMake to specificly name the generated makefile.
Tell Make to use that makefile.
QMake additional arguments: -o smds-test.mk
Make additional arguments : -f smds-test.mk

==== Step 3
In "Project->Dependencies" setup dependencies and check synchronize configurations.
Create a new session with the loaded projects.
Place a dummy "Makefile" in every configuration output directory.
